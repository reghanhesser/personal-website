## About Me

Hello! I am a Finance student at Lehigh University, earning my BA in May 2024. Originally from Scranton, PA, I plan on staying on the East Coast post-grad. Here at Lehigh, I am on the executive boards of the Alpha Phi sorority and the Lehigh Italian Club, and I tutor local middle schoolers at the Bethlehem Public Library. In my free time, I love to cook, style clothing, lift weights, and host dinner parties for my friends.

## Career Objectives

I look forward to my Wealth Management post-grad position in Philadelphia. However, my true passions lie within the food/home media industry, so I am still applying for finance and strategic planning positions within those fields. Having spent a semester of college in Paris, France, studying Luxury Brand Marketing and Management, I am also interested in a career working with brand partnerships for media companies.
